# cloud-tools

Docker Image to work with cloud tools like AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, Docker, Kubernetes, Openshift, Helm, Ansible, Terraform and HashiCorp Vault. It's the toolchain I'm working with on a daily basis, packed into a docker image with both zsh and bash to have a platform-independent development environment.
